# Androids
Androids mod for RimWorld.


Steam (B18): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2889326293&tscn=1668656052

And the license is as usual for all my mods: Feel free to use any of my code as long as you credit me somewhere.

# Objectives/Intentions
Remove body master from the pickable traits for (human) androids as it makes the Vanometric Cell upgrade useless (they are about the same thing)
